# Neuron Network With Kotlin
---
Author: Chenhui Zhang && Yihong Jian

For the final project of CS199IKP, we're planning to write a simple fully connected neuron network using kotlin. We will be implementing the forward path and backpropogation from scratch using ktnumpy, the kotlin equivalence of python numpy. Hopefully we should at least get some good results with the NMIST dataset.

Depending on time availability, we could improve the network by implementing convolution or batchnorms.
