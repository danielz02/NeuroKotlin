# Neural Network With Kotlin
---
Author: Chenhui Zhang && Yihong Jian

For the final project of CS199 IKP, we're planning to write a simple fully connected neural network using kotlin. We will be implementing the forward path and backpropagation from scratch using ktnumpy, the kotlin equivalence of python numpy. Hopefully we should at least get some good results with the MNIST dataset.

Depending on time availability, we could improve the network by implementing convolution or batch norms.
